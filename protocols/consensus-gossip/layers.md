# CONS and GOSSIP

CometBFT is a state machine replication framework and part of the stack used in the Cosmos ecosystem to build distributed applications, directly or through the Cosmos SDK.
CometBFT uses its northbound API, ABCI, to communicate with applications.
South of CometBFT is the OS' network stack.

CometBFT is implemented in a modular way, separating protocol implementations into **reactors**.
Reactors communicate with their counterparts on other nodes using the P2P layer, through what we will call the **P2P-I**.

```

```

The Consensus Reactor is further divided into two layers:

- **CONS**, keeps the state and transition functions described in the [Tendermint BFT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938) and uses gossiping to communicate with other nodes.
- **GOSSIP**, keeps state and transition functions needed to implement the gossiping of proposals and votes of the Tendermint algorithm on top of the 1-to-1 communication facilities provided by the P2P layer.

In the context of this specification, exchanges between CONS and GOSSIP happen through the **GOSSIP-I** interface.
